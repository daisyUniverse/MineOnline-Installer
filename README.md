# MineOnline-Installer
A Simple MSI packaging of MineOnline to facilitate winget installs - Simply installs the MineOnline.exe file to Program Files, and installs a shortcut to the start menu and to the desktop :)


Uninstallation Works* but only removes the launcher EXE and the shortcuts - Does not remove the file structure created by MineOnline
