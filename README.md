# MineOnline-Installer
A Simple MSI packaging of [MineOnline](https://github.com/craftycodie/MineOnline) an open source Minecraft launcher created by [Codie Stella](https://twitter.com/craftycodie) to facilitate winget installs - Simply installs the MineOnline.exe file to Program Files, and installs a shortcut to the start menu and to the desktop :)


Uninstallation Works but only removes the launcher EXE and the shortcuts - Minecraft directory should remain untouched

This MSI was generated using [Master Packager](https://www.masterpackager.com/)
